## About this repository

Contains the frontend assets for HydePHP.

### About the files

- **Hyde.css**:
The Hyde stylesheet contains a small set of styles that don't make sense to use with Tailwind. Normally, this file is imported into the main.css file.

- **App.css**:
A compiled and minified file containing the TailwindCSS styles for a base Hyde installation. It includes the Hyde.css file.

## Usage

HydeFront is included with [HydePHP](https://github.com/hydephp/hyde) by default.

## Warranty:
HydeFront is not intended to be used for standalone projects and comes with no warranties. Changes in HydeFront are tied to those in the Hyde Framework and differing versions may be incompatible.

## Beta software notice
HydePHP is currently in beta. Please report any bugs and issues in the appropriate issue tracker. Versions in the 0.x series are not stable and may change at any time. No backwards compatibility guarantees are made and breaking changes are <s>possible</s> <i>expected</i>.

## v2.0 Release Notes

HydeFront version 2.0 is a major release and has several breaking changes.
It is not compatible with HydePHP versions lower than v0.50.0-beta.

Many files have been removed, as HydePHP now uses Alpine.js for interactions, and TailwindCSS for the documentation pages.

HydeFront v1.x will receive security fixes only.
